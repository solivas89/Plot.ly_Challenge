## The Belly Button Interactive Website
Hello, welcome to my interactive dashboard. Here you will be able to view a rather interesting data set that will show
a variety of different microbes that colonize in human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, 
in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Navigating The Website
https://solivas89.github.io/Plot.ly_Challenge/StarterCode/

Once the site listed above is visited you will be able to see the belly button data mentioned above displayed for your 
viewing pleasure. 

To access and manipulate the data, please select a Test Subject ID No. from the drop down field which you will find to the 
left of the page. It will default to ID No. 940. Once you select an ID No. you will notice that both the Bar Graph to the 
right and the bubble chart below update instantly along with some Demographic information in the table below the drop down. 

The data described below was taken from a sample of data that was obtained utilizing D3. It was then filtered, mapped, sliced 
reveresed, and appended to display and populate the data and visuals you will see on the website.

## The Bar Graph
The bar graph you are seeing is being updated to show the top 10 OTUs found in an individual (ID No.). You will see the OTU ID 
on the left axis as the top 10 Sample Values streatch to the right along the bottom axis. Please feel free to hover over the 
bars as the OTU Labels will dsiplay for viewing. 

## The Bubble Graph
The bubble graph shown is being updated to show the OUT ID on the bottom axis and the Sample Values on the left axis. You may 
also notice the varying size of the bubbles. The Sample Values were also used to determine the size of the bubbles displayed.


## The Demographic Info Table
The demographic table obtained infromation by obtaining the metadata in the sample data. Once the data was obtained, it is then 
populated into the table based on the ID No. selected from the Drop Down. 

Enjoy looking into and seeing the data on my interactive dashboard. I hope it opens up a world of Belly Button Biodiversity for 
you as it has done for me.
